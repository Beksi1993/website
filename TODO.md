## Age groups trends
- synthesize data into series for each age group
- organize `CasesByAgeGroupsForDay` case into a dictionary instead of a list
- what data type for data series?
    - for each series, an array of pojos with x, y, date
    - for whole chart: an array of pojos, with `data` as series data
- prepare basic rendering class
- chart showing age groups for new daily cases 
- show the average age trendline
